               <h2>Spoiler alert:</h2> 
               <h3>this is not about money.</h3>
               <p>Growing up in a rural community of 4,000 people, 
                I could never imagine where I’d be today. My idyllic childhood 
                was a blend of riding horses, learning cake decorating in 4-H, 
                and witnessing people give selflessly despite having little themselves. 
                But beneath the surface, my town faced violent crime rates four times the 
                national average and had a wildly high teen pregnancy rate. This duality shaped my 
                understanding of life and money. 
                </p>
               <br>
                <p class="p-space">Luckily, I had hit the jackpot with my wonderfully loving parents. 
                    My dad was an elementary school teacher and college tennis coach, 
                    and my mom was a teacher to blind children. They sacrificed everything 
                    for my brother and me. I vividly remember my dad working tirelessly in 
                    the summer heat one year to make extra money in order to treat me to 
                    the varsity volleyball ‘team shoe’. It was then, at a very tender age, 
                    that I realized money wasn’t about wealth or amassing ‘things’ – 
                    it was a gateway to access freedom, education, and experiences.

                    <p>
                        At 18, I left home and became financially independent, working multiple 
                        jobs while studying finance, thinking it would lead to personal financial 
                        success. Despite graduating early with both a bachelor’s and master’s degree 
                        in finance, and landing a prestigious Wall Street job, I quickly realized how 
                        little I knew about personal finance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold">
                        On my first day of work as an investment banker –the most prestigious Wall Street 
                        job available to new grads - I was asked by HR if I wanted a 401K or a Roth for retirement 
                        savings. I returned that question with a blank stare on my face and panicked: I had absolutely no idea. 
                        I had TWO degrees in finance, graduated at the top of my class, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks: while 
                        I knew corporate finance, the world does not educate people – and especially women - how to personally thrive with finances. 
                        You must learn it yourself – luckily, I’m here to tell you everything you need to know from the ground up!

                        After investment banking, I became a stock picker at one of the most prestigious investment funds in the country. 
                        I loved it. <span> I was a top shareholder in Starbucks, Chipotle, lululemon, Facebook, and lots of other amazing companies. 
                        I regularly got to meet with Howard Schultz (founder of Starbucks), Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), 
                        Tim Cook (Apple), and many other household name CEOs. But it came at a cost</span> – 6 days a week in the office, late nights, 
                        and lot of time on airplanes, not to mention an extremely toxic culture.

                    <p class="p-space">
                        For the next many years I worked through corporate turnarounds, working grueling hours, through holidays and weekends, 
                        in attempts to right the ship of several companies. Some had wildly successful results and some were duds.  
                        But I truly enjoyed the work; however, <span>I always felt a twinge that I wasn’t providing a better and broader impact to the world, 
                        and that troubled me.</span>

                At 36, as Chief Financial Officer of a $100 million fintech company, I felt a calling to a greater purpose: 
                empowering women to achieve financial freedom so they could live the life they’ve always dreamed of. 
                With my hard-earned 'F**k You Fund,' I made a life-changing pivot to dedicate myself to this mission."

                    Did you know that women save less than 50% of what men save, and carry 30% more debt? 
                    Many women avoid discussing finances for fear of judgment, often leaving them trapped in 
                    relationships, jobs, or environments that they can’t escape. With my help, any woman can 
                    build a 'F**k You Fund' and live a meaningful life they've always dreamed of.
