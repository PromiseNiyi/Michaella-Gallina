               <p>Growing up in a rural community of 4,000 people, I could never imagine where I’d be today. 
                My idyllic childhood was a blend of riding horses, learning cake decorating in 4-H, and 
                witnessing people give selflessly despite having little themselves. But beneath the surface, 
                my town faced violent crime rates four times the national average and had a wildly high teen pregnancy rate. 
                This duality shaped my understanding of life and money.

                <p class="p-space">Luckily, I <u><i>had</i></u> hit the jackpot with my wonderfully loving parents, 
                    who were both teachers and consistently sacrificed everything for my brother and me.

                    amassing ‘things’ – it was a gateway to access freedom, education, and experiences.</b>

                        At 18, I became financially independent, working multiple jobs while studying finance, 
                        thinking it would lead to personal financial success. 
                        Despite graduating early with both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in finance, 
                        and landing a prestigious Wall Street job, 
                        I quickly realized how little I knew about personal finance.

                        had graduated at the top of my class, but did not know the answers to basic personal finance questions. 
                        That’s when I realized that the world does not educate people – and especially women –

                        not to mention many extremely toxic cultures. Working through corporate turnarounds resulted in the same grueling hours.
